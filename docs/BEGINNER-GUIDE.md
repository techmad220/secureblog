```

## Step 5: Preview Locally (1 minute)

### Python (usually pre-installed)
```bash
cd build
python -m http.server 8000
# Or for Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Open your browser to: http://localhost:8000

### No Python? Use Node.js

3. Upload your `build` folder
4. Done! You get a free `*.pages.dev` URL

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Post
1. Create new `.md` file in `content/posts/`
2. Run `go run cmd/main_v2.go`
3. Upload new `build/` folder

### Changing the Look
Edit `templates/index.html` and `templates/post.html`
- Change colors in `<style>` section

## Troubleshooting

### "go: command not found"
Go isn't installed. Return to Step 1.

You're in the wrong folder. Use `cd` to navigate to secureblog folder.

### Build errors
```bash
# Fix missing dependencies
go mod download

# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf build
go run cmd/main_v2.go
```

### Page looks broken
Check you're viewing through a web server (Step 5), not opening HTML files directly.

## Security Check

After deploying, verify your security:
1. Go to https://securityheaders.com
2. Enter your blog URL
3. You should get an A+ rating!
